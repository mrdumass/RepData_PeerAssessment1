# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
act<-read.csv("activity.csv")
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
stepsperday<-as.vector(tapply(act$step,act$date,sum))  
hist(stepsperday,main="Histogram of Total Steps Per Day",xlab="Steps")  
```
The mean is
```{r}
mean(stepsperday,na.rm=TRUE)  
```
The median is
```{r}
median(stepsperday,na.rm=TRUE)  
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Average the number of steps for each interval for all days
removing the missing. Plot that versus intervals in a day
```{r}
averagesteps<-tapply(act$steps,act$interval,mean,na.rm=TRUE)
plot(names(averagesteps),as.vector(averagesteps),type="l",main="Average Steps per Interval",ylab="Steps",xlab="interval")
```
## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
