# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
act<-read.csv("activity.csv")
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
stepsperday<-as.vector(tapply(act$step,act$date,sum))  
hist(stepsperday,main="Histogram of Total Steps Per Day",xlab="Steps")  
```
The mean is
```{r}
mean(stepsperday,na.rm=TRUE)  
```
The median is
```{r}
median(stepsperday,na.rm=TRUE)  
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
